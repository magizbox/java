            "text": "Variable \n Types\n\n\nAlthough Java is object oriented, not all types are objects. It is built on top of basic variable types called primitives.\n\n\nHere is a list of all primitives in Java:\n\n\n\n\nbyte\n (number, 1 byte)\n\n\nshort\n (number, 2 bytes)\n\n\nint\n (number, 4 bytes)\n\n\nlong\n (number, 8 bytes)\n\n\nfloat\n (float number, 4 bytes)\n\n\ndouble\n (float number, 8 bytes)\n\n\nchar\n (a character, 2 bytes)\n\n\nboolean\n (true or false, 1 byte)\nJava is a strong typed language, which means variables need to be defined before we use them.\n\n\n\n\nNumbers\n\n\nTo declare and assign a number use the following syntax:\n\n\nint myNumber;\nmyNumber = 5;\n\n\n\n\nOr you can combine them:\n\n\nint myNumber = 5;\n\n\n\n\nTo define a double floating point number, use the following syntax:\n\n\ndouble d = 4.5;\nd = 3.0;\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to use float, you will have to cast:\n\n\nfloat f = (float) 4.5;\n\n\n\n\nOr, You can use this:\n\n\nfloat f = 4.5f (f is a shorter way of casting float)\n\n\n\n\nCharacters and Strings\n\n\nIn Java, a character is it's own type and it's not simply a number, so it's not common to put an ascii value in it, there is a special syntax for chars:\n\n\nchar c = 'g';\n\n\n\n\nString is not a primitive. It's a real type, but Java has special treatment for String.\n\n\nHere are some ways to use a string:\n\n\n// Create a string with a constructor\nString s1 = new String(\nWho let the dogs out?\n);\n// Just using \n creates a string, so no need to write it the previous way.\nString s2 = \nWho who who who!\n;\n// Java defined the operator + on strings to concatenate:\nString s3 = s1 + s2;\n\n\n\n\nThere is no operator overloading in Java! The operator + is only defined for strings, you will never see it with other objects, only primitives.\n\n\nYou can also concat string to primitives:\n\n\nint num = 5;\nString s = \nI have \n + num + \n cookies\n; //Be sure not to use \n with primitives.\n\n\n\n\nboolean\n\n\nEvery comparison operator in java will return the type \nboolean\n that not like other languages can only accept two special values: \ntrue\n or \nfalse\n.\n\n\nboolean b = false;\nb = true;\n\nboolean toBe = false;\nb = toBe || !toBe;\nif (b) {\n    System.out.println(toBe);\n}\n\nint children = 0;\nb = children; // Will not work\nif (children) { // Will not work\n    // Will not work\n}\n\n\n\n\nOperators\n\n\nJava provides a rich set of operators to manipulate variables. We can divide all the Java operators into the following groups:\n\n\n\n\nArithmetic Operators\n\n\nRelational Operators\n\n\nBitwise Operators\n\n\nLogical Operators\n\n\nAssignment Operators\n\n\nMisc Operators\n\n\n\n\nThe Arithmetic Operators\n\n\nArithmetic operators are used in mathematical expressions in the same way that they are used in algebra.\n\n\nThe following table lists the arithmetic operators:\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \nOperator\n\n    \nDescription\n\n    \nExample\n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \n+ (Addition)\n\n    \nAdds values on either side of the operator\n\n    \n10 + 20 -\n 30\n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \n- (Subtraction)\n\n    \nSubtracts right hand operand from left hand operand\n\n    \n10 - 20\n-\n -10\n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \n* ( Multiplication )\n\n    \nMultiplies values on either side of the operator\n\n    \n10 *\n20\n-\n 200\n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \n/ (Division)\n\n    \nDivides left hand operand by right hand operand\n\n    \n20 / 10 -\n 2\n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \n% (Modulus)\n\n    \nDivides left hand operand by right hand operand and returns remainder\n\n    \n7\n% 3 -\n1\n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \n++ (Increment)\n\n    \nIncreases the value of operand by 1\n\n    \n\n      \na = 20\n\n\n      \na++ -\n 21\n\n    \n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \n-- ( Decrement )\n\n    \nDecreases the value of operand by 1\n\n    \n\n      \na = 20\n\n\n      \na-- -\n 19\n\n    \n\n  \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nThe Relational Operators\n\n\nThere are following relational operators supported by Java language\n\n\n== (equal to)\nChecks if the values of two operands are equal or not, if yes then condition becomes true.\n\n\nExample: (A == B) is not true.\n2   != (not equal to)\nChecks if the values of two operands are equal or not, if values are not equal then condition becomes true.\n\n\nExample: (A != B) is true.\n\n\n3   \n (greater than)\nChecks if the value of left operand is greater than the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true.\n\n\nExample: (A \n B) is not true.\n4   \n (less than)\nChecks if the value of left operand is less than the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true.\n\n\nExample: (A \n B) is true.\n5   \n= (greater than or equal to)\nChecks if the value of left operand is greater than or equal to the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true.\n\n\nExample (A \n= B) is not true.\n6   \n= (less than or equal to)\nChecks if the value of left operand is less than or equal to the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true.\n\n\nexample(A \n= B) is true.\n\n\nThe Bitwise Operators\n\n\nJava defines several bitwise operators, which can be applied to the integer types, long, int, short, char, and byte.\n\n\nBitwise operator works on bits and performs bit-by-bit operation. Assume if a = 60; and b = 13; now in binary format they will be as follows:\n\n\na = 0011 1100\n\n\nb = 0000 1101\n\n\n\n\na\nb = 0000 1100\n\n\na|b = 0011 1101\n\n\na^b = 0011 0001\n\n\n~a  = 1100 0011\n\n\nThe following table lists the bitwise operators:\n\n\nAssume integer variable A holds 60 and variable B holds 13 then:\n\n\n (bitwise and)\nBinary AND Operator copies a bit to the result if it exists in both operands.\n\n\nExample: (A \n B) will give 12 which is 0000 1100\n2   | (bitwise or)\nBinary OR Operator copies a bit if it exists in either operand.\n\n\nExample: (A | B) will give 61 which is 0011 1101\n3   ^ (bitwise XOR)\nBinary XOR Operator copies the bit if it is set in one operand but not both.\n\n\nExample: (A ^ B) will give 49 which is 0011 0001\n4   ~ (bitwise compliment)\nBinary Ones Complement Operator is unary and has the effect of 'flipping' bits.\n\n\nExample: (~A ) will give -61 which is 1100 0011 in 2's complement form due to a signed binary number.\n5   \n (left shift)\nBinary Left Shift Operator. The left operands value is moved left by the number of bits specified by the right operand\n\n\nExample: A \n 2 will give 240 which is 1111 0000\n6   \n (right shift)\nBinary Right Shift Operator. The left operands value is moved right by the number of bits specified by the right operand.\n\n\nExample: A \n 2 will give 15 which is 1111\n7   \n (zero fill right shift)\nShift right zero fill operator. The left operands value is moved right by the number of bits specified by the right operand and shifted values are filled up with zeros.\n\n\nExample: A \n2 will give 15 which is 0000 1111\n\n\nThe Logical Operators\n\n\nThe following table lists the logical operators:\n\n\nAssume Boolean variables A holds true and variable B holds false, then:\n\n\n (logical and)\nCalled Logical AND operator. If both the operands are non-zero, then the condition becomes true.\n\n\nExample (A \n B) is false.\n2   || (logical or)\nCalled Logical OR Operator. If any of the two operands are non-zero, then the condition becomes true.\n\n\nExample (A || B) is true.\n3   ! (logical not)\nCalled Logical NOT Operator. Use to reverses the logical state of its operand. If a condition is true then Logical NOT operator will make false.\n\n\nExample !(A \n B) is true.\n\n\nThe Assignment Operators\n\n\nThere are following assignment operators supported by Java language:\n\n\nShow Examples\n\n\nSR.NO   Operator and Description\n1   =\nSimple assignment operator, Assigns values from right side operands to left side operand.\n\n\nExample: C = A + B will assign value of A + B into C\n2   +=\nAdd AND assignment operator, It adds right operand to the left operand and assign the result to left operand.\n\n\nExample: C += A is equivalent to C = C + A\n3   -=\nSubtract AND assignment operator, It subtracts right operand from the left operand and assign the result to left operand.\n\n\nExample:C -= A is equivalent to C = C - A\n4   *=\nMultiply AND assignment operator, It multiplies right operand with the left operand and assign the result to left operand.\n\n\nExample: C *= A is equivalent to C = C * A\n5   /=\nDivide AND assignment operator, It divides left operand with the right operand and assign the result to left operand\n\n\nExampleC /= A is equivalent to C = C / A\n6   %=\nModulus AND assignment operator, It takes modulus using two operands and assign the result to left operand.\n\n\nExample: C %= A is equivalent to C = C % A\n7   \n=\nLeft shift AND assignment operator.\n\n\nExampleC \n= 2 is same as C = C \n 2\n8   \n=\nRight shift AND assignment operator\n\n\nExample C \n= 2 is same as C = C \n 2\n9   \n=\nBitwise AND assignment operator.\n\n\nExample: C \n= 2 is same as C = C \n 2\n10  ^=\nbitwise exclusive OR and assignment operator.\n\n\nExample: C ^= 2 is same as C = C ^ 2\n11  |=\nbitwise inclusive OR and assignment operator.\n\n\nExample: C |= 2 is same as C = C | 2\n\n\nMiscellaneous Operators\n\n\nThere are few other operators supported by Java Language.\n\n\nConditional Operator ( ? : )\nConditional operator is also known as the ternary operator. This operator consists of three operands and is used to evaluate Boolean expressions. The goal of the operator is to decide which value should be assigned to the variable. The operator is written as:\n\n\nvariable x = (expression) ? value if true : value if false\n\n\n\n\nFollowing is the example:\n\n\npublic class Test {\n\n   public static void main(String args[]){\n      int a, b;\n      a = 10;\n      b = (a == 1) ? 20: 30;\n      System.out.println( \nValue of b is : \n +  b );\n\n      b = (a == 10) ? 20: 30;\n      System.out.println( \nValue of b is : \n + b );\n   }\n}\n\n\n\n\nThis would produce the following result ?\n\n\nValue of b is : 30\nValue of b is : 20\n\n\n\n\nPrecedence of Operators\n\n\nOperator precedence determines the grouping of terms in an expression. This affects how an expression is evaluated. Certain operators have higher precedence than others; for example, the multiplication operator has higher precedence than the addition operator:\n\n\nFor example, x = 7 + 3 * 2; here x is assigned 13, not 20 because operator * has higher precedence than +, so it first gets multiplied with 3*2 and then adds into 7.\n\n\nHere, operators with the highest precedence appear at the top of the table, those with the lowest appear at the bottom. Within an expression, higher precedence operators will be evaluated first.\n\n\nCategory    Operator    Associativity \nPostfix     () [] . (dot operator)  Left toright \nUnary   ++ - - ! ~  Right to left \nMultiplicative      * / %   Left to right \nAdditive    + -     Left to right \nShift   \n \n \n   Left to right \nRelational      \n \n= \n \n=   Left to right \nEquality    == !=   Left to right \nBitwise AND     \n   Left to right \nBitwise XOR     ^   Left to right \nBitwise OR  |   Left to right \nLogical AND     \n  Left to right \nLogical OR  ||  Left to right \nConditional     ?:  Right to left \nAssignment  = += -= *= /= %= \n= \n= \n= ^= |=   Right to left \n\n\nConditional\n\n\nJava uses boolean variables to evaluate conditions. The boolean values \ntrue\n and \nfalse\n are returned when an expression is compared or evaluated. For example:\n\n\nint a = 4;\nboolean b = a == 4;\n\nif (b) {\n    System.out.println(\nIt's true!\n);\n}\n\n\n\n\nOf course we don't normally assign a conditional expression to a boolean, we just use the short version:\n\n\nint a = 4;\n\nif (a == 4) {\n    System.out.println(\nOhhh! So a is 4!\n);\n}\n\n\n\n\nBoolean operators\n\n\nThere aren't that many operators to use in conditional statements and most of them are pretty strait forward:\n\n\nint a = 4;\nint b = 5;\nboolean result;\nresult = a \n b; // true\nresult = a \n b; // false\nresult = a \n= 4 // a smaller or equal to 4 - true\nresult = b \n= 6 // b bigger or equal to 6 - false\nresult = a == b // a equal to b - false\nresult = a != b // a is not equal to b - true\nresult = a \n b || a \n b // Logical or - true\nresult = 3 \n a \n a \n 6 // Logical and - true\nresult = !result // Logical not - false\n\n\n\n\nif - else and between\n\n\nThe if, else statement in java is pretty simple.\n\n\nif (a == b) {\n    // a and b are equal, let's do something cool\n}\n\n\n\n\nAnd we can also add an else statement after an if, to do something if the condition is not true\n\n\nif (a == b) {\n    // We already know this part\n} else {\n    // a and b are not equal... :/\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe if - else statements doesn't have to be in several lines with {}, if can be used in one line, or without the {}, for a single line statment.\n\n\nif (a == b)\n    System.out.println(\nAnother line Wow!\n);\nelse\n    System.out.println(\nDouble rainbow!\n);\n\n\n\n\nAlthough this method might be useful for making your code shorter by using fewer lines, we strongly recommend for beginners not to use this short version of statements and always use the full version with {}. This goes to every statement that can be shorted to a single line (for, while, etc).\n\n\nThe ugly side of if\n\n\nThere is a another way to write a one line if - else statement by using the operator ? :\n\n\nint a = 4;\nint result = a == 4 ? 1 : 8;\n\n// result will be 1\n// This is equivalent to\nint result;\n\nif (a == 4) {\n    result = 1;\n} else {\n    result = 8;\n}\n\n\n\n\nAgain, we strongly recommend for beginners not to use this version of if.\n\n\n== and equals\n\n\nThe operator == works a bit different on objects than on primitives. When we are using objects and want to check if they are equal, the operator == will say if they are the same, if you want to check if they are logically equal, you should use the equals method on the object. For example:\n\n\nString a = new String(\nWow\n);\nString b = new String(\nWow\n);\nString sameA = a;\n\nboolean r1 = a == b;      // This is false, since a and b are not the same object\nboolean r2 = a.equals(b); // This is true, since a and b are logically equals\nboolean r3 = a == sameA;  // This is true, since a and sameA are really the same object",

In order to declare a variable that will hold an array of integers, we use the following syntax:  int[] arr;  Notice there is no size, since we didn't create the array yet.  arr = new int[10];  This will create a new array with the size of 10. We can check the size by printing the array's length:  System.out.println(arr.length);  We can access the array and set values:  arr[0] = 4;\narr[1] = arr[0] + 5;  Java arrays are 0 based, which means the first element in an array is accessed at index 0 (e.g: arr[0], which accesses the first element). Also, as an example, an array of size 5 will only go up to index 4 due to it being 0 based.  int[] arr = new int[5]\n//accesses and sets the first element\narr[0] = 4;  We can also create an array with values in the same line:  int[] arr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};  Don't try to print the array without a loop, it will print something nasty like [I@f7e6a96.",

            "text": "Java is an Object-Oriented Language. As a language that has the Object-Oriented feature, Java supports the following fundamental concepts\n\n\n\n\nInheritance\n\n\nPolymorphism\n\n\nEncapsulation\n\n\nAbstraction\n\n\nClasses\n\n\nObjects\n\n\nInstance\n\n\nMethod\n\n\nMessage Parsing\n\n\n\n\nIn this chapter, we will look into the concepts - Classes and Objects.\n\n\n\n\nObject\n \u2212 Objects have states and behaviors. Example: A dog has states - color, name, breed as well as behaviors \u2013 wagging the tail, barking, eating. An object is an instance of a class.\n\n\nClass\n \u2212 A class can be defined as a template/blueprint that describes the behavior/state that the object of its type support.\n\n\n\n\nObjects\n\n\nLet us now look deep into what are objects. If we consider the real-world, we can find many objects around us, cars, dogs, humans, etc. All these objects have a state and a behavior.\n\n\nIf we consider a dog, then its state is - name, breed, color, and the behavior is - barking, wagging the tail, running.\n\n\nIf you compare the software object with a real-world object, they have very similar characteristics.\n\n\nSoftware objects also have a state and a behavior. A software object's state is stored in fields and behavior is shown via methods.\n\n\nSo in software development, methods operate on the internal state of an object and the object-to-object communication is done via methods.\n\n\nClasses\n\n\nA class is a blueprint from which individual objects are created.\n\n\nFollowing is a sample of a class.\n\n\nExample\n\n\npublic class Dog {\n   String breed;\n   int ageC\n   String color;\n\n   void barking() {\n   }\n\n   void hungry() {\n   }\n\n   void sleeping() {\n   }\n}\n\n\n\n\nA class can contain any of the following variable types.\n\n\n\n\nLocal variables\n \u2212 Variables defined inside methods, constructors or blocks are called local variables. The variable will be declared and initialized within the method and the variable will be destroyed when the method has completed.\n\n\nInstance variables\n \u2212 Instance variables are variables within a class but outside any method. These variables are initialized when the class is instantiated. Instance variables can be accessed from inside any method, constructor or blocks of that particular class.\n\n\nClass variables\n \u2212 Class variables are variables declared within a class, outside any method, with the static keyword.\n\n\n\n\nA class can have any number of methods to access the value of various kinds of methods. In the above example, barking(), hungry() and sleeping() are methods.\n\n\nFollowing are some of the important topics that need to be discussed when looking into classes of the Java Language.\n\n\nConstructors\n\n\nWhen discussing about classes, one of the most important sub topic would be constructors. Every class has a constructor. If we do not explicitly write a constructor for a class, the Java compiler builds a default constructor for that class.\n\n\nEach time a new object is created, at least one constructor will be invoked. The main rule of constructors is that they should have the same name as the class. A class can have more than one constructor.\n\n\nFollowing is an example of a constructor \u2212\n\n\nExample\n\n\npublic class Puppy {\n   public Puppy() {\n   }\n\n   public Puppy(String name) {\n      // This constructor has one parameter, name.\n   }\n}\n\n\n\n\nJava also supports Singleton Classes where you would be able to create only one instance of a class.\n\n\nNote\n \u2212 We have two different types of constructors. We are going to discuss constructors in detail in the subsequent chapters.\n\n\nCreating an Object\n\n\nAs mentioned previously, a class provides the blueprints for objects. So basically, an object is created from a class. In Java, the new keyword is used to create new objects.\n\n\nThere are three steps when creating an object from a class \u2212\n\n\n\n\nDeclaration\n \u2212 A variable declaration with a variable name with an object type.\n\n\nInstantiation\n \u2212 The 'new' keyword is used to create the object.\n\n\nInitialization\n \u2212 The 'new' keyword is followed by a call to a constructor. This call initializes the new object.\n\n\n\n\nFollowing is an example of creating an object \u2212\n\n\nExample\n\n\npublic class Puppy {\n   public Puppy(String name) {\n      // This constructor has one parameter, name.\n      System.out.println(\nPassed Name is :\n + name );\n   }\n\n   public static void main(String []args) {\n      // Following statement would create an object myPuppy\n      Puppy myPuppy = new Puppy( \ntommy\n );\n   }\n}\n\n\n\n\nIf we compile and run the above program, then it will produce the following result \u2212\n\n\nPassed Name is :tommy\n\n\n\n\nAccessing Instance Variables and Methods\n\n\nInstance variables and methods are accessed via created objects. To access an instance variable, following is the fully qualified path \u2212\n\n\n/* First create an object */\nObjectReference = new Constructor();\n\n/* Now call a variable as follows */\nObjectReference.variableName;\n\n/* Now you can call a class method as follows */\nObjectReference.MethodName();\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\nThis example explains how to access instance variables and methods of a class.\n\n\npublic class Puppy {\n   int puppyAge;\n\n   public Puppy(String name) {\n      // This constructor has one parameter, name.\n      System.out.println(\nName chosen is :\n + name );\n   }\n\n   public void setAge( int age ) {\n      puppyAge = age;\n   }\n\n   public int getAge( ) {\n      System.out.println(\nPuppy's age is :\n + puppyAge );\n      return puppyAge;\n   }\n\n   public static void main(String []args) {\n      /* Object creation */\n      Puppy myPuppy = new Puppy( \ntommy\n );\n\n      /* Call class method to set puppy's age */\n      myPuppy.setAge( 2 );\n\n      /* Call another class method to get puppy's age */\n      myPuppy.getAge( );\n\n      /* You can access instance variable as follows as well */\n      System.out.println(\nVariable Value :\n + myPuppy.puppyAge );\n   }\n}\n\n\n\n\nIf we compile and run the above program, then it will produce the following result\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nName chosen is :tommy\nPuppy's age is :2\nVariable Value :2\n\n\n\n\nSource File Declaration Rules\n\n\nAs the last part of this section, let's now look into the source file declaration rules. These rules are essential when declaring classes, import statements and package statements in a source file.\n\n\n\n\nThere can be only one public class per source file.\n\n\nA source file can have multiple non-public classes.\n\n\nThe public class name should be the name of the source file as well which should be appended by .java at the end. For example: the class name is public class Employee{} then the source file should be as Employee.java.\n\n\nIf the class is defined inside a package, then the package statement should be the first statement in the source file.\n\n\nIf import statements are present, then they must be written between the package statement and the class declaration. If there are no package statements, then the import statement should be the first line in the source file.\n\n\nImport and package statements will imply to all the classes present in the source file. It is not possible to declare different import and/or package statements to different classes in the source file.\n\n\n\n\nClasses have several access levels and there are different types of classes; abstract classes, final classes, etc. We will be explaining about all these in the access modifiers chapter.\n\n\nApart from the above mentioned types of classes, Java also has some special classes called Inner classes and Anonymous classes.\n\n\nJava Package\n\n\nIn simple words, it is a way of categorizing the classes and interfaces. When developing applications in Java, hundreds of classes and interfaces will be written, therefore categorizing these classes is a must as well as makes life much easier.\n\n\nImport Statements\n\n\nIn Java if a fully qualified name, which includes the package and the class name is given, then the compiler can easily locate the source code or classes. Import statement is a way of giving the proper location for the compiler to find that particular class.\n\n\nFor example, the following line would ask the compiler to load all the classes available in directory java_installation/java/io \u2212\n\n\nimport java.io.*;\n\n\n\n\nA Simple Case Study\n\n\nFor our case study, we will be creating two classes. They are Employee and EmployeeTest.\n\n\nFirst open notepad and add the following code. Remember this is the Employee class and the class is a public class. Now, save this source file with the name Employee.java.\n\n\nThe Employee class has four instance variables - name, age, designation and salary. The class has one explicitly defined constructor, which takes a parameter.\n\n\nExample\n\n\nimport java.io.*;\npublic class Employee {\n\n   String name;\n   int age;\n   String designation;\n   double salary;\n\n   // This is the constructor of the class Employee\n   public Employee(String name) {\n      this.name = name;\n   }\n\n   // Assign the age of the Employee  to the variable age.\n   public void empAge(int empAge) {\n      age = empAge;\n   }\n\n   /* Assign the designation to the variable designation.*/\n   public void empDesignation(String empDesig) {\n      designation = empDesig;\n   }\n\n   /* Assign the salary to the variable salary.*/\n   public void empSalary(double empSalary) {\n      salary = empSalary;\n   }\n\n   /* Print the Employee details */\n   public void printEmployee() {\n      System.out.println(\nName:\n+ name );\n      System.out.println(\nAge:\n + age );\n      System.out.println(\nDesignation:\n + designation );\n      System.out.println(\nSalary:\n + salary);\n   }\n}\n\n\n\n\nAs mentioned previously in this tutorial, processing starts from the main method. Therefore, in order for us to run this Employee class there should be a main method and objects should be created. We will be creating a separate class for these tasks.\n\n\nFollowing is the EmployeeTest class, which creates two instances of the class Employee and invokes the methods for each object to assign values for each variable.\n\n\nSave the following code in EmployeeTest.java file.\n\n\nimport java.io.*;\npublic class EmployeeTest {\n\n   public static void main(String args[]) {\n      /* Create two objects using constructor */\n      Employee empOne = new Employee(\nJames Smith\n);\n      Employee empTwo = new Employee(\nMary Anne\n);\n\n      // Invoking methods for each object created\n      empOne.empAge(26);\n      empOne.empDesignation(\nSenior Software Engineer\n);\n      empOne.empSalary(1000);\n      empOne.printEmployee();\n\n      empTwo.empAge(21);\n      empTwo.empDesignation(\nSoftware Engineer\n);\n      empTwo.empSalary(500);\n      empTwo.printEmployee();\n   }\n}\n\n\n\n\nNow, compile both the classes and then run EmployeeTest to see the result as follows \u2212\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nC:\\\n javac Employee.java\nC:\\\n javac EmployeeTest.java\nC:\\\n java EmployeeTest\nName:James Smith\nAge:26\nDesignation:Senior Software Engineer\nSalary:1000.0\nName:Mary Anne\nAge:21\nDesignation:Software Engineer\nSalary:500.0",

In the Java language, classes can be derived from other classes, thereby inheriting fields and methods from those classes.\n\n\nThe idea of inheritance is simple but powerful: When you want to create a new class and there is already a class that includes some of the code that you want, you can derive your new class from the existing class. In doing this, you can reuse the fields and methods of the existing class without having to write (and debug!) them yourself.\n\n\nA subclass inherits all the members (fields, methods, and nested classes) from its superclass. Constructors are not members, so they are not inherited by subclasses, but the constructor of the superclass can be invoked from the subclass.\n\n\nClass Hierarchy\n\n\nThe Object class, defined in the java.lang package, defines and implements behavior common to all classes\u2014including the ones that you write. In the Java platform, many classes derive directly from Object, other classes derive from some of those classes, and so on, forming a hierarchy of classes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the top of the hierarchy, Object is the most general of all classes. Classes near the bottom of the hierarchy provide more specialized behavior.\n\n\nAn Example\n\n\nHere is the sample code for a possible implementation of a Bicycle class that was presented in the Classes and Objects lesson:\n\n\npublic class Bicycle {\n\n    // the Bicycle class has three fields\n    public int cadence;\n    public int gear;\n    public int speed;\n\n    // the Bicycle class has one constructor\n    public Bicycle(int startCadence, int startSpeed, int startGear) {\n        gear = startGear;\n        cadence = startCadence;\n        speed = startSpeed;\n    }\n\n    // the Bicycle class has four methods\n    public void setCadence(int newValue) {\n        cadence = newValue;\n    }\n\n    public void setGear(int newValue) {\n        gear = newValue;\n    }\n\n    public void applyBrake(int decrement) {\n        speed -= decrement;\n    }\n\n    public void speedUp(int increment) {\n        speed += increment;\n    }\n\n}\n\n\n\n\nA class declaration for a MountainBike class that is a subclass of Bicycle might look like this:\n\n\npublic class MountainBike extends Bicycle {\n\n    // the MountainBike subclass adds one field\n    public int seatHeight;\n\n    // the MountainBike subclass has one constructor\n    public MountainBike(int startHeight,\n                        int startCadence,\n                        int startSpeed,\n                        int startGear) {\n        super(startCadence, startSpeed, startGear);\n        seatHeight = startHeight;\n    }\n\n    // the MountainBike subclass adds one method\n    public void setHeight(int newValue) {\n        seatHeight = newValue;\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nMountainBike inherits all the fields and methods of Bicycle and adds the field seatHeight and a method to set it. Except for the constructor, it is as if you had written a new MountainBike class entirely from scratch, with four fields and five methods. However, you didn't have to do all the work. This would be especially valuable if the methods in the Bicycle class were complex and had taken substantial time to debug.\n\n\nWhat You Can Do in a Subclass\n\n\nA subclass inherits all of the public and protected members of its parent, no matter what package the subclass is in. If the subclass is in the same package as its parent, it also inherits the package-private members of the parent. You can use the inherited members as is, replace them, hide them, or supplement them with new members:\n\n\n\n\nThe inherited fields can be used directly, just like any other fields.\n\n\nYou can declare a field in the subclass with the same name as the one in the superclass, thus hiding it (not * recommended).\n\n\nYou can declare new fields in the subclass that are not in the superclass.\n\n\nThe inherited methods can be used directly as they are.\n\n\nYou can write a new instance method in the subclass that has the same signature as the one in the superclass, thus  overriding it.\n\n\nYou can write a new static method in the subclass that has the same signature as the one in the superclass, thus hiding it.\n\n\nYou can declare new methods in the subclass that are not in the superclass.\n\n\nYou can write a subclass constructor that invokes the constructor of the superclass, either implicitly or by using the keyword super.\n\n\n\n\nThe following sections in this lesson will expand on these topics.\n\n\nPrivate Members in a Superclass\n\n\nA subclass does not inherit the private members of its parent class. However, if the superclass has public or protected methods for accessing its private fields, these can also be used by the subclass.\n\n\nA nested class has access to all the private members of its enclosing class\u2014both fields and methods. Therefore, a public or protected nested class inherited by a subclass has indirect access to all of the private members of the superclass.\n\n\nCasting Objects\n\n\nWe have seen that an object is of the data type of the class from which it was instantiated. For example, if we write\n\n\npublic MountainBike myBike = new MountainBike();\n\n\n\n\nthen myBike is of type MountainBike.\n\n\nMountainBike is descended from Bicycle and Object. Therefore, a MountainBike is a Bicycle and is also an Object, and it can be used wherever Bicycle or Object objects are called for.\n\n\nThe reverse is not necessarily true: a Bicycle may be a MountainBike, but it isn't necessarily. Similarly, an Object may be a Bicycle or a MountainBike, but it isn't necessarily.\n\n\nCasting shows the use of an object of one type in place of another type, among the objects permitted by inheritance and implementations. For example, if we write\n\n\nObject obj = new MountainBike();\n\n\n\n\nthen obj is both an Object and a MountainBike (until such time as obj is assigned another object that is not a MountainBike). This is called implicit casting.\n\n\nIf, on the other hand, we write\n\n\nMountainBike myBike = obj;\n\n\n\n\nwe would get a compile-time error because obj is not known to the compiler to be a MountainBike. However, we can tell the compiler that we promise to assign a MountainBike to obj by explicit casting:\n\n\nMountainBike myBike = (MountainBike)obj;\n\n\n\n\nThis cast inserts a runtime check that obj is assigned a MountainBike so that the compiler can safely assume that obj is a MountainBike. If obj is not a MountainBike at runtime, an exception will be thrown.\n\n\nRelated Readings\n\n\n\n\n\"Inheritance\". \ndocs.oracle.com\n. N.p., 2016.
